## 2.1 3553NT14L SSH C0MM4ND5

SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol that allows you to securely connect to and control remote computers over the internet. It encrypts all the data you send and receive, ensuring your communications are private and secure. Some of the essential SSH commands you'll use include:

- `ssh`: The main command to establish a secure connection to a remote server.
- `scp`: A tool for securely copying files between your local machine and a remote server.
- `sftp`: An interactive file transfer protocol that provides a familiar FTP-like interface for managing files on a remote server.

These commands form the foundation of your SSH usage, allowing you to access and manage remote systems as if you were sitting right in front of them.

## 2.2 ESTABLISH1NG A REM0TE C0NNECTI0N

To connect to a remote server using SSH, you'll use the following command:

```bash
ssh [options] username@remote_host
```

- `username`: The user account on the remote server.
- `remote_host`: The server's IP address or domain name.
- Example: `ssh john@example.com`

![SSH First Connection](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5b2fc4f-d56c-41a5-8fa6-cb4aad2163ba)

This command is like a digital handshake with the remote server, allowing you to control it as if you were sitting in front of it. The SSH client on your local machine initiates a secure connection with the SSH server on the remote host, authenticating your identity and establishing an encrypted communication channel.

Common Options:
- `-p port`: Specify a non-standard SSH port to connect to.
- `-i identity_file`: Use a specific private key for authentication, instead of the default `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
- `-X`: Enable X11 forwarding, which allows you to run graphical applications on the remote server and display them on your local machine.
- `-v`: Enable verbose mode, which provides more detailed information about the connection process and can be useful for troubleshooting.

Security Note:
- On the first connection to a remote server, you'll be asked to verify the server's host key to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
- The host key is stored in the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file for future connections, so you don't have to verify it again.
- Use `ssh -v` to troubleshoot connection issues and see detailed information about the SSH handshake and authentication process.

## 2.3 EX3CUT1NG REM0TE C0MMANDE

In addition to establishing a full SSH session, you can also execute commands on a remote server without starting a full interactive session:

```bash
ssh username@remote_host 'command'
```

This is like sending a quick task to the server, executing the command, and returning the result. It's useful for running one-off commands or automating tasks on the remote system.

Examples:
- Check uptime: `ssh john@example.com 'uptime'`
- View disk usage: `ssh john@example.com 'df -h'`
- Update packages: `ssh john@example.com 'sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y'`

Advanced Tips:
- You can chain multiple commands together using the `&&` operator, like this: `ssh user@host 'command1 && command2'`.

## 2.4 S3CUR3 F1L3 TR4NSF3R W1TH SCP

SCP (Secure Copy) is a tool for transferring files between local and remote systems securely. It uses the SSH protocol to encrypt the data during the transfer, ensuring your files remain private and protected from eavesdropping.

Upload a File to a Remote Server:

```bash
scp [options] source_file(s) username@remote_host:destination
```

Download a File from a Remote Server:

```bash
scp [options] username@remote_host:source_file(s) destination
```

![SCP File Transfer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6aa4862c-ca36-4b6f-9880-567686568ca9)

Examples:
- Upload: `scp /path/to/local/file.txt john@example.com:/home/john/`
- Download: `scp john@example.com:/home/john/file.txt /local/path/`
- Transfer directory: `scp -r /local/dir john@example.com:/remote/dir`

Options:
- `-P port`: Specify a non-standard SSH port to use for the file transfer.
- `-i identity_file`: Use a specific private key for authentication, instead of the default `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
- `-l limit`: Limit the bandwidth used during the file transfer.
- `-C`: Compress the files during the transfer, which can improve performance over slow network connections.

## 2.5 INTERACTIVE FILE MANAGEMENT WITH SFTP

SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) offers a more interactive approach to file management on remote servers. It provides an FTP-like interface, but with the added security and encryption of the SSH protocol.

Start an SFTP Session:

```bash
sftp [options] username@remote_host
```

![SFTP Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de4ba01f-93b0-4ed6-909f-5b88f45dc2a5)

Essential SFTP Commands:
- `put local_file [remote_file]`: Upload a file to the remote server.
- `get remote_file [local_file]`: Download a file from the remote server.
- `ls [directory]`: List the files in the current remote directory.
- `cd directory`: Change the current remote directory.
- `lcd directory`: Change the current local directory.
- `mkdir directory`: Create a new directory on the remote server.
- `rm file`: Delete a file on the remote server.
- `rmdir directory`: Remove a directory on the remote server.
- `pwd`: Show the current remote directory.
- `lpwd`: Show the current local directory.
- `bye` or `exit`: End the SFTP session.

![SFTP Connection](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a68d910b-10b5-4afe-9424-bc049c8481e2)

Advanced Usage:
- Batch Mode: You can automate tasks with an SFTP script by using the `-b batch_file` option.
- Recursive Operations: Use the `-r` option with `put` or `get` to transfer directories recursively.

## 2.6 B3ST PR4CT1C35

To ensure the security and reliability of your SSH connections, it's important to follow best practices:

- Always use strong, unique passwords or SSH keys for authentication.
- Regularly update your SSH client and server software to the latest versions.
- Disable root login for SSH connections to improve security.
- Use a firewall to limit SSH access to only the necessary IP addresses or networks.
- Monitor your SSH logs for any unusual activity or failed login attempts.
