```

### üì∏ Screenshot Description:
This diagram illustrates the fundamental concept of an SSH connection. You'll see two systems represented: a client (typically your local machine) on the left, and a server (the remote system you're connecting to) on the right. Between them, there's a visual representation of the internet, depicted as a chaotic cloud to symbolize the potential security risks of unencrypted communication.

The key element is a bold, green arrow running from the client to the server, representing the SSH tunnel. This arrow passes through the internet cloud unaffected, demonstrating how SSH creates a secure channel through potentially unsafe networks. Small lock icons at each end of the arrow emphasize the encrypted nature of the connection.

Alongside the diagram, you'll find brief annotations explaining:
1. Client-side encryption
2. Secure transmission through the internet
3. Server-side decryption

This visual aid helps to conceptualize how SSH provides a safe passage for your data, even when traversing unsecured networks.

> Knock on the door of a remote computer:

```bash
# Basic incantation
ssh username@hostname

# Example for the chosen one:
ssh neo@matrix.com

# Sneaking through a different port (default: 22)
ssh -p 2222 username@hostname

### üì∏ Screenshot Description:
This screenshot provides a step-by-step visual guide to establishing an SSH connection. The image displays a terminal or command prompt window, showcasing the entire connection process from start to finish.

Key elements you'll observe:

1. **Command Entry**: At the top, you'll see the SSH command being entered: `ssh username@hostname`.

2. **Fingerprint Prompt**: Following the command, there's a message about the server's fingerprint. This is a security feature to verify the server's identity. It typically appears only on the first connection to a new server.

3. **Password Prompt**: Next, you'll see a prompt asking for the user's password. For security reasons, the password characters are not displayed as they're typed.

4. **Welcome Message**: Upon successful authentication, you'll see a welcome message or MOTD (Message of the Day) from the server.

5. **New Command Prompt**: Finally, you'll observe a new command prompt, typically ending with a `$` or `#` symbol, indicating you're now connected to the remote system.

Each step is clearly labeled, and important security notices or prompts are highlighted for emphasis. This screenshot provides a clear, visual reference for users to understand what to expect when initiating an SSH connection, enhancing their confidence in using the protocol.
