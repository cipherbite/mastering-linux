## üõ°Ô∏è Hardening SSH Security

Enhance your SSH security posture by employing these advanced techniques designed to create a robust defense against potential threats. Each step contributes to building a multi-layered security framework that mitigates risks and fortifies your SSH environment.

1. **Fortify Encryption**
   Improve encryption strength by configuring robust ciphers, MACs, and key exchange algorithms. This ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over SSH.

   ```bash
   # Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

   # Add or modify these lines
   Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com
   MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com
   KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,diffie-hellman-group16-sha512

   # Restart SSH service
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   ```

   Description: These commands update the SSH configuration to use strong, modern encryption algorithms, enhancing the security of SSH connections.

2. **Automate Key Rotation**
   Implement automated key rotation to regularly update SSH keys, minimizing the risk of compromised credentials. Regular key rotation is a vital aspect of managing the lifecycle of SSH keys.

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   NEW_KEY="id_ed25519_$(date +%Y%m%d)"
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/$NEW_KEY -C "rotated_key_$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
   ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/$NEW_KEY.pub user@remote_host
   sed -i "s/IdentityFile ~\/.ssh\/id_ed25519/IdentityFile ~\/.ssh\/$NEW_KEY/" ~/.ssh/config
   ssh user@remote_host "sed -i '/old_key/d' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
   ```

   Description: This script generates a new ED25519 key, copies it to the remote host, updates the local SSH config, and removes the old key from the remote authorized_keys file.

3. **Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
   Strengthen authentication mechanisms by integrating two-factor authentication (2FA), providing an additional layer of security beyond traditional passwords.

   ```bash
   # Install Google Authenticator PAM module
   sudo apt-get install libpam-google-authenticator

   # Configure PAM for SSH
   echo "auth required pam_google_authenticator.so" | sudo tee -a /etc/pam.d/sshd

   # Enable challenge-response authentication in SSH config
   echo "ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config

   # Restart SSH service
   sudo systemctl restart sshd

   # Set up 2FA for the current user
   google-authenticator
   ```

   Description: These commands install and configure Google Authenticator for SSH, enabling 2FA for enhanced security.

### Security Architecture Overview

![SSH Srcurity Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c536b0c-1e0e-47f8-9c71-c9936e3de40c)

**Screenshot Description:**
This image shows a detailed diagram of the SSH security architecture. It's divided into three main sections: the client-side, the network, and the server-side. On the client-side, you can see various SSH clients (PuTTY, OpenSSH) connecting through different authentication methods (passwords, keys, 2FA). The network section illustrates encrypted data tunnels. The server-side shows the SSH daemon, along with security modules like PAM, firewall rules, and logging mechanisms. Arrows indicate the flow of data and authentication processes.

## üîç SSH Auditing and Logging

Implement comprehensive surveillance on your SSH channels to detect and respond to potential security threats:

1. **Enhanced Reconnaissance**
   Configure verbose logging to capture detailed information about SSH connections and activities.

   ```bash
   # Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

   # Add or modify this line
   LogLevel VERBOSE

   # Restart SSH service
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   ```

   Description: This configuration enables verbose logging for SSH, providing more detailed information about connections and activities.

2. **Centralized Intelligence Gathering**
   Set up centralized logging to collect SSH logs from multiple servers in one location for easier analysis.

   ```bash
   # On the central log server, edit /etc/rsyslog.conf
   sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.conf

   # Add these lines to enable TCP syslog reception
   module(load="imtcp")
   input(type="imtcp" port="514")

   # On each SSH server, edit /etc/rsyslog.d/10-ssh.conf
   sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.d/10-ssh.conf

   # Add this line to forward SSH logs
   if $programname == 'sshd' then @@central_log_server:514

   # Restart rsyslog on all servers
   sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
   ```

   Description: These configurations set up a central log server to collect SSH logs from multiple servers, facilitating centralized monitoring and analysis.

3. **Covert Data Management**
   Implement log rotation to manage log file sizes and retention periods effectively.

   ```bash
   # Create or edit /etc/logrotate.d/ssh
   sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/ssh

   # Add these lines
   /var/log/ssh.log {
       rotate 7
       daily
       compress
       missingok
       notifempty
   }
   ```

   Description: This configuration sets up log rotation for SSH logs, keeping them manageable and ensuring older logs are archived or deleted as needed.

### üêç Clandestine Log Analyzer

Here's a Python script to analyze SSH logs and identify potential security issues:

```python

    failed_attempts, successful_logins = Counter(), Counter()

    with open(log_file, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            if 'Failed password' in line:
                ip = re.search(ip_pattern, line)
                if ip: failed_attempts[ip.group()] += 1
            elif 'Accepted publickey' in line:
                ip = re.search(ip_pattern, line)
                if ip: successful_logins[ip.group()] += 1

    print("Top 5 IPs with failed password attempts:")
    for ip, count in failed_attempts.most_common(5):
        print(f"{ip}: {count}")

    print("\nTop 5 IPs with successful logins:")
    for ip, count in successful_logins.most_common(5):
        print(f"{ip}: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python ssh_log_analyzer.py /path/to/ssh.log")
        sys.exit(1)
    analyze_ssh_log(sys.argv[1])
```

Description: This Python script analyzes SSH logs to identify patterns of failed login attempts and successful logins, helping to detect potential brute-force attacks or unusual access patterns.
