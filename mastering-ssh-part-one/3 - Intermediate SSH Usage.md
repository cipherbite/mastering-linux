## üõ°Ô∏è Hardening SSH Security

Enhance your SSH security posture by employing these advanced techniques designed to create a robust defense against potential threats. Each step contributes to building a multi-layered security framework that mitigates risks and fortifies your SSH environment.

1. **Fortify Encryption**
   Improve encryption strength by configuring robust ciphers, MACs, and key exchange algorithms. This ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over SSH.

   <details>
   <summary>View Encryption Configuration</summary>

   ```bash
   # /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com
   MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com
   KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,diffie-hellman-group16-sha512
   ```
   </details>

2. **Automate Key Rotation**
   Implement automated key rotation to regularly update SSH keys, minimizing the risk of compromised credentials. Regular key rotation is a vital aspect of managing the lifecycle of SSH keys.

   <details>
   <summary>Reveal Key Rotation Script</summary>

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   NEW_KEY="id_ed25519_$(date +%Y%m%d)"
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/$NEW_KEY -C "rotated_key_$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
   ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/$NEW_KEY.pub user@remote_host
   sed -i "s/IdentityFile ~\/.ssh\/id_ed25519/IdentityFile ~\/.ssh\/$NEW_KEY/" ~/.ssh/config
   ssh user@remote_host "sed -i '/old_key/d' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
   ```
   </details>

3. **Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
   Strengthen authentication mechanisms by integrating two-factor authentication (2FA), providing an additional layer of security beyond traditional passwords.

   <details>
   <summary>Unveil 2FA Setup</summary>

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libpam-google-authenticator
   echo "auth required pam_google_authenticator.so" | sudo tee -a /etc/pam.d/sshd
   echo "ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```
   </details>

### Security Architecture Overview

![SSH Srcurity Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c536b0c-1e0e-47f8-9c71-c9936e3de40c)

**Screenshot Description:**
This image shows a detailed diagram of the SSH security architecture. It's divided into three main sections: the client-side, the network, and the server-side. On the client-side, you can see various SSH clients (PuTTY, OpenSSH) connecting through different authentication methods (passwords, keys, 2FA). The network section illustrates encrypted data tunnels. The server-side shows the SSH daemon, along with security modules like PAM, firewall rules, and logging mechanisms. Arrows indicate the flow of data and authentication processes.
