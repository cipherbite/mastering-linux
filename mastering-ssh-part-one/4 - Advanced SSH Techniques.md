## 1. 🚀 Advanced SSH Tunneling

### 1.1 Dynamic Tunneling with Compression and Keepalive

```bash
ssh -C -D 8080 -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -o ServerAliveCountMax=5 user@remote_host
```

This command creates a dynamic SOCKS tunnel on port 8080 with compression enabled (-C) and keepalive settings to maintain the connection even during long idle periods.

### 1.2 Multi-level Tunneling

```bash
ssh -L 8080:localhost:9090 user1@host1 ssh -L 9090:localhost:80 user2@host2
```

This advanced command creates a tunnel through two hosts, allowing access to a service on `host2:80` via `localhost:8080`.

### 1.3 Reverse Tunneling with Key Authentication and Custom Port

```bash
ssh -R 8080:localhost:80 -i ~/.ssh/custom_key -p 2222 user@remote_host
```

This command creates a reverse tunnel using a custom SSH key and port.

## 2. 🔓 Securely Bypassing Firewalls

### 2.1 SSH over HTTP

When the standard SSH port (22) is blocked, you can tunnel SSH through HTTP:

```bash
ssh -o ProxyCommand='corkscrew proxy.example.com 80 %h %p' user@remote_host
```

This command uses the `corkscrew` tool to tunnel SSH through an HTTP proxy.

### 2.2 SSH over SSL

For even greater security and camouflage, you can tunnel SSH through SSL:

```bash
ssh -o ProxyCommand='openssl s_client -connect %h:%p -quiet' user@remote_host
```

This method makes SSH traffic look like standard HTTPS connections.

## 3. 🕸️ Creating a VPN with SSH

### 3.1 Creating a TUN/TAP Tunnel

```bash
ssh -w 0:0 user@remote_host
```

This command creates a TUN interface at both ends of the SSH connection, allowing IP routing.

### 3.2 Configuring Routing and iptables

On the local host:
```bash
sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev tun0
sudo ip route add 10.0.0.0/24 dev tun0
```

On the remote host:
```bash
sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.2/24 dev tun0
sudo ip route add 10.0.0.0/24 dev tun0
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
```

These commands configure routing and NAT for your SSH VPN.

## 4. 🔌 Remote Power Management via SSH

### 4.1 Remote Wake-on-LAN

```bash
ssh user@gateway_host "wakeonlan AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
```

This command sends a Wake-on-LAN packet to a specific computer via the gateway host.

### 4.2 Remote Sleep or Shutdown

```bash
ssh user@remote_host "sudo systemctl suspend"
```

or

```bash
ssh user@remote_host "sudo shutdown -h now"
```

These commands allow you to remotely put machines to sleep or shut them down.

## 5. 📡 SSH over Tor

### 5.1 Configuring a Hidden Service

In the `torrc` file on the server:

```
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22
```

### 5.2 Connecting via Tor

```bash
torsocks ssh user@onionaddress.onion
```

This method allows anonymous SSH connections through the Tor network.

## 6. 🔧 Advanced Diagnostics and Debugging

### 6.1 Verbose Logging

```bash
ssh -vvv user@remote_host
```

This command enables very detailed logging, which is useful for troubleshooting.

### 6.2 Debugging with strace

```bash
strace -f -e trace=network ssh user@remote_host
```

This command traces all network-related system calls during the SSH session.

### 6.3 Analyzing SSH Packets

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 'tcp port 22' -w ssh_traffic.pcap
```

This command captures SSH traffic for later analysis.

## 7. 🔒 Hardening SSH

### 7.1 Configuring Fail2Ban

```bash
sudo apt install fail2ban
sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

Edit the [sshd] section in the jail.local file:

```
[sshd]
enabled = true
port = ssh
filter = sshd
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 3
bantime = 3600
```

### 7.2 Using SSH Certificates Instead of Keys

Generating a certificate:

```bash
ssh-keygen -s ca_key -I user_id -n user,root -V +52w /path/to/user_key.pub
```

Server configuration in `sshd_config`:

```
TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ca.pub
```

## 8. 🤖 Automation with SSH

### 8.1 Remote Script Execution

```bash
ssh user@remote_host 'bash -s' < local_script.sh
```

This command executes a local script on the remote host.

### 8.2 File Synchronization with rsync over SSH

```bash
rsync -avz -e "ssh -i ~/.ssh/custom_key -p 2222" /local/path/ user@remote_host:/remote/path/
```

This command synchronizes files using rsync over an SSH tunnel with a custom key and port.

### 8.3 Automatic Tunneling with autossh

```bash
autossh -M 0 -o "ServerAliveInterval 30" -o "ServerAliveCountMax 3" -L 5000:localhost:3306 user@remote_host
```

This command uses autossh to maintain a stable SSH tunnel, automatically reconnecting if the connection drops.
