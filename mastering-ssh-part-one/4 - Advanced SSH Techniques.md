## 4.1 SSH Security Monitoring and Auditing

SSH security monitoring and auditing are critical for maintaining a secure environment. This section discusses how to set up logging, analyze logs, and implement intrusion detection systems to enhance your SSH security.

### 4.1.1 Logging SSH Activities

To comprehensively log SSH activities, configure the `LogLevel` in your SSH server configuration:

```plaintext
LogLevel VERBOSE
```

This setting, located in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, provides detailed logs about login attempts, key usage, and session activitiesâ€”crucial data for monitoring and auditing.

**Screenshot Description:** The screenshot shows the SSH server configuration file (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) with the `LogLevel VERBOSE` setting highlighted. This setting ensures that the SSH server logs detailed information about user activities, which is essential for security monitoring and auditing.

### 4.1.2 Analyzing SSH Logs

Analyzing SSH logs helps detect suspicious activities. Focus on the following log files:

- `/var/log/auth.log` (Debian/Ubuntu)
- `/var/log/secure` (Red Hat/CentOS)

Here are some useful commands:

```bash
# Count failed login attempts
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | wc -l

# List unique IP addresses of failed attempts
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | awk '{print $11}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

- The first command counts the number of failed login attempts, which can indicate potential brute-force attacks.
- The second command identifies the unique IP addresses that have attempted to log in unsuccessfully, allowing you to track the origin of the failed login attempts.

**Screenshot Description:** The terminal output shows the result of running the second command, which lists the IP addresses that have attempted to log in unsuccessfully, sorted by the number of failed attempts. This information helps identify the source of potential brute-force attacks on the SSH server.

### 4.1.3 Implementing Intrusion Detection

**Fail2Ban** automates blocking suspicious IP addresses. To set up Fail2Ban for SSH:

1. Install Fail2Ban:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install fail2ban
    ```

2. Configure the SSH jail:
    ```bash
    sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
    sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
    ```

3. Add the following SSH-specific settings:
    ```plaintext
    [sshd]
    enabled = true
    port = ssh
    filter = sshd
    logpath = /var/log/auth.log
    maxretry = 3
    bantime = 3600
    ```

This configuration bans IP addresses after three failed login attempts for one hour.

**Screenshot Description:** The screenshot shows the Fail2Ban configuration file (`/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`) with the `[sshd]` section highlighted. This section configures Fail2Ban to monitor the SSH server's log file (`/var/log/auth.log`) for failed login attempts, and to automatically ban any IP address that exceeds the specified number of failed attempts (3) for a certain duration (1 hour).

## 4.2 SSH Escape Sequences

SSH escape sequences allow you to manage SSH connections dynamically without terminating the session. These sequences are especially useful for handling unresponsive connections and inspecting forwarded ports.

### 4.2.1 Common Escape Sequences

Here are some commonly used escape sequences:

| Sequence | Description                           |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| `~.`     | Immediately terminate the connection. |
| `~^Z`    | Suspend the session and return to the local shell. |
| `~#`     | List all forwarded connections.       |
| `~?`     | Show a list of available escape sequences. |
| `~~`     | Send the escape character itself.     |

These sequences are essential for managing unresponsive sessions or port forwarding.

![ssh-escape-sequence](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddd8b7eb-3fe3-45aa-885a-6260548c9fc5)

**Screenshot Description:** The terminal output shows the result of typing the `~?` escape sequence, which displays a list of all available SSH escape sequences and their corresponding actions. This information is crucial for understanding how to effectively manage and control an active SSH session.

---

### 4.2.2 Using Escape Sequences

To use an escape sequence, press `Enter` to start a new line, then type the sequence. For instance, `~.` will immediately terminate the session.

**Screenshot Description:** The screenshot demonstrates the use of the `~.` escape sequence to immediately terminate the current SSH session. This is a valuable tool for quickly and safely disconnecting from an unresponsive or problematic SSH connection.

## 4.3 SSH Honeypots

SSH honeypots are deceptive systems designed to attract and monitor attackers. These honeypots collect data on attack methods and behaviors, enhancing overall security.

### 4.3.1 Setting Up a Basic SSH Honeypot

**Kippo** is a widely used low-interaction SSH honeypot. Here's how to set it up:

1. Clone Kippo from GitHub:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/desaster/kippo.git
    cd kippo
    ```

2. Configure Kippo:
    ```bash
    cp kippo.cfg.dist kippo.cfg
    nano kippo.cfg
    ```

3. Edit key settings:
    ```plaintext
    ssh_port = 2222
    hostname = FakeServer
    ```

4. Start Kippo:
    ```bash
    ./start.sh
    ```

This setup simulates a vulnerable SSH server on port 2222, capturing attacker interactions.

![kippo-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff329295-21fc-42be-a85d-b9365ea91932)

**Screenshot Description:** The screenshot shows the Kippo honeypot's log file (`kippo.log`), which displays the unauthorized access attempts that have been captured by the honeypot. This information is valuable for analyzing the tactics and techniques used by potential attackers, allowing you to enhance the overall security of your SSH infrastructure.

---

### 4.3.2 Analyzing Honeypot Data

Kippo logs are stored in the `log` directory. You can analyze these logs using tools like the **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to visualize attack patterns.

## 4.4 SSH and Containers

SSH can be integrated with containers for secure management of isolated environments. This section covers running SSH inside Docker containers and using SSH agent forwarding with containers.

### 4.4.1 Running an SSH Server in a Docker Container

Here is a basic Dockerfile to run an SSH server inside a container:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y openssh-server
RUN mkdir /var/run/sshd
RUN echo 'root:password' | chpasswd
RUN sed -i 's/#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

EXPOSE 22

CMD ["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D"]
```

Build and run the container:

```bash
docker build -t ssh-server .
docker run -d -p 2222:22 ssh-server
```

![docker](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56dd2384-b9a3-41f4-b72d-7cdf68ad45f6)

**Screenshot Description:** The screenshot shows a terminal session where a Docker container with an SSH server is running. The container's SSH server is listening on port 2222, and the user can connect to it using SSH from the host system.

---

### 4.4.2 SSH Agent Forwarding with Docker

To enable SSH agent forwarding inside a Docker container, mount your local SSH agent:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $SSH_AUTH_SOCK:/ssh-agent \
  -e SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/ssh-agent \
  ubuntu /bin/bash
```

This allows your container to use SSH keys from your local environment.

**Screenshot Description:** The screenshot demonstrates the successful use of SSH agent forwarding within a Docker container. By mounting the host system's SSH agent socket (`$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`) and setting the appropriate environment variable, the container can access the user's local SSH keys, enabling seamless authentication with remote systems.

---

## 4.5 Best Practices

Following SSH best practices helps maintain a secure environment. Here are some key recommendations:

1. **Enforce strong authentication**: Use SSH key-based authentication instead of passwords, and disable password login for added security.
2. **Implement two-factor authentication (2FA)**: Tools like Google Authenticator or Duo add an extra layer of protection.
3. **Restrict access to known IP addresses**: Use `AllowUsers` or `AllowGroups` in `sshd_config` to limit who can log in.
4. **Deploy honeypots**: Use honeypots to gather intelligence on potential attacks.
5. **Secure containers**: Ensure SSH containers are isolated and properly segmented within the network.
